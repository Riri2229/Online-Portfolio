                <h3>Influential Speakers</h3>
                <p></strong> Adam Brown </strong>:</strong> Adam Brown, who works at Workday, came into our class talking about how CS works at Workday. He helped us understand how not every CS/ IT Job has to include knowing programming languages. His insights into the workings of a tech company and the role of computer science in industry were eye-opening and helped me realize how to move forward in high school with my career. </p>
                <p></strong> Lakshmi Hanspal </strong>:</strong> Mrs. Hanspal showed us all about how AI works. She kept the topic very exciting as she introduced ways to show our creativity in AI. Mrs. Hanspal has interested me in learning more about AI and showing my creativity through CS. Her presentation influenced me and helped me understand how I can always start my career in Computer Science with any idea I have, and bring it to life. I appreciate her coming into our class and speaking on behalf of her knowledge and AI as a whole. </p>
                <h3>Mentor Experience</h3>
                <p>My dance teacher was an amazing mentor for me. The experiences that she had brought up to me as a student have influenced me to never give up. She has taught me ways to improve myself and to stay focused on improving to reach my goals. Thanks to her, I have made many major improvements in myself, not only in dance but also in my daily life.</p>
                <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
                <p> At a young age, I started learning a traditional dance behind my indian culture, called Kathak. I have perfected my moves and technique with this Dance throughout my whole life, and have been going to the same dance instructor ever since I started. Recently as I got older, I have started to volunteer here because I have gotten to the point where there is not much left to learn. I aim to impact young students like I once was and help them achieve big things! .</p>
